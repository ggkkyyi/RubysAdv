README – Ruby’s Adventure
Known issues – The health bar UI in the build is stretched, but still has functionality. I could not figure out a solution in time.
There were many challenges when doing the tutorial such as animations and coding issues, but a few tweaks would fix the issues.
When opening project from GitHub, clone the repo, open the project in Unity and select “MainScene” from Assets/Scenes.
Teammate – Grace Yip. Things are going well.
